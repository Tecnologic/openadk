		Multicast is becoming a major component in next generation 
		networks, used in several scenarios, from video broadcasting 
		to multimedia conferencing. In order to be implemented, new 
		technology needs supporting hardware and software across a set 
		of devices and systems. MRD6 is an implementation of a modular 
		IPv6 Multicast Routing Framework for the Linux operating system 
		and provides MLDv2 (as well as MLDv1), PIM-SM and MBGP support.

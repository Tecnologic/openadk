	  mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
	  shell (pdksh), a bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-
	  milar to the original AT&T Korn shell.  It includes bug fixes
	  and feature improvements in order to produce a modern, robust
	  shell good for interactive and especially script use.  It has
	  UTF-8 support in the emacs command line editing mode; corres-
	  ponds to OpenBSD 4.4-beta ksh without GNU bash-like $PS1; the
	  build environment requirements are autoconfigured; throughout
	  code simplification/bugfix/enhancement has been done, and the
	  shell has extended compatibility to other modern shells.

	  This package also installs mksh as /bin/ash and /bin/sh (i.e.
	  the default Bourne/POSIX shell) and creates a ~/.mkshrc file,
	  which can be used to further customise the look and feel.

	  Disable this to remove a few functions from mksh to make it smaller.
	  Ideal for embedded systems. However, be aware you will lose some
	  functionality you'd otherwise expect, among these is the vi command
	  line editing mode.

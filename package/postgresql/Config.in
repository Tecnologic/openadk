	  PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) 
	  based on POSTGRES, Version 4.2, developed at the University of 
	  California at Berkeley Computer Science Department. POSTGRES pioneered 
	  many concepts that only became available in some commercial database 
	  systems much later.

	  PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. 
	  It supports SQL92 and SQL99 and offers many modern features:

	    * complex queries
	    * foreign keys
	    * triggers
	    * views
	    * transactional integrity
	    * multiversion concurrency control

	  This package contains the shared client library, needed by other programs.

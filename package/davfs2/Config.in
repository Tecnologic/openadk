	  WebDAV is an extension to HTTP that allows remote collaborative
	  authoring of Web resources, defined in RFC 2518.
	  
	  davfs2 is a Linux file system driver that allows you to mount a
	  WebDAV server as a local file system, like a disk drive. This
	  way applications can access resources on a Web server without
	  knowing anything about HTTP or WebDAV.
	  
	  davfs2 runs as a daemon in userspace. It uses the kernel file
	  system coda or fuse. To connect to the WebDAV
	  server it makes use of the neon library. Neon supports TLS/SSL
	  (using OpenSSL or GnuTLS) and access via proxy server.
	  
	  davfs2 allows you to e.g.
	  * use a WebDAV server as workspace for a geographically
	    distributed work group.
	  * save documents on a WebDAV server and access and edit them
	    via internet from wherever you want.
	  * edit a web site in place, using your preferred development
	    tools.

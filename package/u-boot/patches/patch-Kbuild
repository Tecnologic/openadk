Sometimes it is required to build only host U-Boot tools without building
U-Boot itself for either board.

For example:
 * In "buildroot" "uboot-tools" could be built for host just to have an ability
   to create uImage.
 * Linux distributions ship "mkimage" utility as a separate substance.

This patch allows building host U-Boot tools separately from U-Boot itself and
what is more important user only needs to have host compiler (gcc).

To build host tools just execute:
=====
make tools HOST_TOOLS_ONLY=yes
=====

Without this patch to generate tools user needs:
 1. Configure any existing board with "make XXX_config"
 2. Execute tools building but still cross-compiler will be invoked and if
    there's no proper cross-compiler in PATH compilation will fail.

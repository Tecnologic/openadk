	  The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall", is a 
	  high-level tool for configuring Netfilter. You describe your 
	  firewall/gateway requirements using entries in a set of configuration 
	  files. Shorewall reads those configuration files and with the help 
	  of the iptables utility, Shorewall configures Netfilter to match 
	  your requirements.

	help
	  To save space, all shorewall files in /etc/shorewall will get striped.
	  This means that all comments, empty lines etc. are removed.

	  By default this option is not enabled, because the comments
	  in the configfiles helps the user a lot to configure shorewall.

config ADK_PACKAGE_SHOREWALL_STRIPSHARED
	prompt "Strip shared shorewall files (macros & actions mainly)"
	bool
	default y
	depends on ADK_PACKAGE_SHOREWALL
	help
	  To save space, all shared shorewall files in /usr/share/shorewall
	  will get striped. This means that all comments, empty lines etc. 
	  are removed.

	  By default this option is enabled, because for normal usage the user
	  doesn't need to change files in /usr/share/shorewall. Comments in all
	  shared files just would waste disk space on most embedded devices.

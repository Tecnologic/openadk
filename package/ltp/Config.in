	  The Linux Test Project is a joint project started by SGI and 
	  maintained by IBM, that has a goal to deliver test suites to 
	  the open source community that validate the reliability, 
	  robustness, and stability of Linux. The LTP testsuite contains 
	  a collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related 
	  features.

	  BEWARE: this is a very huge package, and therefore merely usable
	          from an embedded system. It will consume about 150MB!

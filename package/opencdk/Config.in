	  This library provides basic parts of the OpenPGP message format.
	  For reference, please read the rfc2440.txt in the doc/ directory.
	  Due to some possible security problems, the library also implements
	  parts of draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc2440bis-08.txt. If you want to exchange
	  messages with earlier PGP version < 7, you should use the compat mode.

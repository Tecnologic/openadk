OpenADK - An embedded Linux construction kit
============================================

This is a menu based buildsystem for your embedded Linux system.

Before you can start you need to install some software:
- bash
- gcc or clang
- g++ or clang++
- binutils 
- GNU make
- tar
- gzip
- wget
- perl
- c library headers
- ncurses library and header
- zlib library and header

There is a check for the required versions of these software in advance, though.
(to re-issue the checks, use "make prereq").

Please use "make menuconfig" to choose your target architecture and
embedded system and configure like you want to.

Simply running 'make' will build the firmware for your embedded system.  The
buildsystem will download all sources, build the toolchain, the kernel and all
applications.

Sunshine!

OpenADK - A GNU/Linux construction kit 
======================================

This is a menu based buildsystem for your home made embedded Linux system.

Before you can start you need to install some tools: 
- bash
- gcc or clang
- g++ or clang++
- binutils 
- GNU make
- tar
- gzip
- wget
- libc headers
- ncurses5 headers
- zlib headers
- perl

There is a check for the required versions of these tools in advance, though.
(to re-issue the checks, use "make prereq").

Please use "make menuconfig" to choose your target architecture and
embedded system and configure like you want to.

Simply running 'make' will build the firmware for your embedded system.  The
buildsystem will download all sources, build the toolchain, the kernel and all
applications.

To switch to another target configuration, simply run "make switch". This will
backup your existing configuration and will start with an empty one.

Sunshine!

m68k: enabled software emulation of separate supervisor/user stack

Recent Coldfires have separate supervisor and user stack pointers, but
since older Coldfires didn't have that, the Linux kernel has a kind of
emulation mechanism for those pointers.

Apparently, according to the Kconfig.cpu file, the 5208 is supposed to
support such separate pointers, but Qemu doesn't implement it. So we
cheat a bit here and force the usage of emulated separate stack
pointers.

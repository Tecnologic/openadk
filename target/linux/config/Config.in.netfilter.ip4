config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_NF_CONNTRACK_IPV4
	bool 'IPv4 connection tracking support (required for NAT)'
	select ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  Connection tracking keeps a record of what packets have passed
	  through your machine, in order to figure out how they are related
	  into connections.

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_CT_ACCT
	bool 'Connection tracking flow accounting'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_NF_CONNTRACK
	help
	  If this option is enabled, the connection tracking code will
	  keep per-flow packet and byte counters.

	  Those counters can be used for flow-based accounting or the
	  `connbytes' match.


config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_IPTABLES
	tristate 'IP tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT)'
	select ADK_KERNEL_NETFILTER_XTABLES
	help
	  iptables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
	  The packet filtering and full NAT (masquerading, port forwarding,
	  etc) subsystems now use this: say `Y' or `M' here if you want to use
	  either of those.

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_FILTER
	tristate 'Packet Filtering'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_IPTABLES
	help
	  Packet filtering defines a table `filter', which has a series of
	  rules for simple packet filtering at local input, forwarding and
	  local output.  See the man page for iptables(8).

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_FULL_NAT
	tristate "Meta package for Full NAT"
	select ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_NF_NAT if ADK_KERNEL_VERSION_3_4_60
	select ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_NF_NAT_IPV4 if ADK_KERNEL_VERSION_3_9_9

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_NF_NAT
	tristate 'Full NAT'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_IPTABLES
	depends on ADK_KERNEL_VERSION_3_4_60
	help
	  The Full NAT option allows masquerading, port forwarding and other
	  forms of full Network Address Port Translation.  It is controlled by
	  the `nat' table in iptables: see the man page for iptables(8).

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_NF_NAT_IPV4
	tristate 'Full NAT'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_IPTABLES
	depends on ADK_KERNEL_VERSION_3_9_9
	help
	  The Full NAT option allows masquerading, port forwarding and other
	  forms of full Network Address Port Translation.  It is controlled by
	  the `nat' table in iptables: see the man page for iptables(8).

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE
	tristate 'MASQUERADE target support'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_FULL_NAT
	help
	  Masquerading is a special case of NAT: all outgoing connections are
	  changed to seem to come from a particular interface's address, and
	  if the interface goes down, those connections are lost.  This is
	  only useful for dialup accounts with dynamic IP address (ie. your IP
	  address will be different on next dialup).

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_TARGET_REJECT
	tristate 'REJECT target support'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_FILTER
	help
	  The REJECT target allows a filtering rule to specify that an ICMP
	  error should be issued in response to an incoming packet, rather
	  than silently being dropped.

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_TARGET_ULOG
	tristate 'ULOG target support (ipv4 only)'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_FILTER
	help
	  This option enables the old IPv4-only "ipt_ULOG" implementation
	  which has been obsoleted by the new "nfnetlink_log" code (see
	  CONFIG_NETFILTER_NETLINK_LOG).

	  This option adds a `ULOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
	  any iptables table. The packet is passed to a userspace logging
	  daemon using netlink multicast sockets; unlike the LOG target
	  which can only be viewed through syslog.

	  The appropriate userspace logging daemon (ulogd) may be obtained from
	  <http://www.gnumonks.org/projects/ulogd/>

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_TARGET_REDIRECT
	tristate 'REDIRECT target support'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_FULL_NAT
	help
	  REDIRECT is a special case of NAT: all incoming connections are
	  mapped onto the incoming interface's address, causing the packets to
	  come to the local machine instead of passing through.  This is
	  useful for transparent proxies.

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_TARGET_NETMAP
	tristate 'NETMAP target support'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_FULL_NAT
	help
	  NETMAP is an implementation of static 1:1 NAT mapping of network
	  addresses. It maps the network address part, while keeping the host
	  address part intact. It is similar to Fast NAT, except that
	  Netfilter's connection tracking doesn't work well with Fast NAT.

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_MANGLE
	tristate 'Packet mangling'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_FULL_NAT
	help
	  This option adds a `mangle' table to iptables: see the man page for
	  iptables(8).  This table is used for various packet alterations
	  which can effect how the packet is routed.

config ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_TARGET_ECN
	tristate 'ECN target support'
	depends on ADK_KPACKAGE_KMOD_IP_NF_MANGLE
	help
	  This option adds a `ECN' target, which can be used in the iptables mangle
	  table.  

	  You can use this target to remove the ECN bits from the IPv4 header of
	  an IP packet.  This is particularly useful, if you need to work around
	  existing ECN blackholes on the internet, but don't want to disable
	  ECN support in general.

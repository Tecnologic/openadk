	  This is the client VFS module for the Common Internet File System
	  (CIFS) protocol which is the successor to the Server Message Block 
	  (SMB) protocol, the native file sharing mechanism for most early
	  PC operating systems.  The CIFS protocol is fully supported by 
	  file servers such as Windows 2000 (including Windows 2003, NT 4  
	  and Windows XP) as well by Samba (which provides excellent CIFS
	  server support for Linux and many other operating systems). Limited
	  support for Windows ME and similar servers is provided as well. 
	  You must use the smbfs client filesystem to access older SMB servers
	  such as OS/2 and DOS.

	  The intent of the cifs module is to provide an advanced
	  network file system client for mounting to CIFS compliant servers, 
	  including support for dfs (hierarchical name space), secure per-user
	  session establishment, safe distributed caching (oplock), optional
	  packet signing, Unicode and other internationalization improvements, 
	  and optional Winbind (nsswitch) integration. You do not need to enable
	  cifs if running only a (Samba) server. It is possible to enable both
	  smbfs and cifs (e.g. if you are using CIFS for accessing Windows 2003
	  and Samba 3 servers, and smbfs for accessing old servers). If you need 
	  to mount to Samba or Windows from this machine, say Y.

	  If you are connected to some other (usually local) Unix computer
	  (using SLIP, PLIP, PPP or Ethernet) and want to mount files residing
	  on that computer (the NFS server) using the Network File Sharing
	  protocol, say Y. "Mounting files" means that the client can access
	  the files with usual UNIX commands as if they were sitting on the
	  client's hard disk. For this to work, the server must run the
	  programs nfsd and mountd (but does not need to have NFS file system
	  support enabled in its kernel). NFS is explained in the Network
	  Administrator's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>, on its man page: "man
	  nfs", and in the NFS-HOWTO.

	  A superior but less widely used alternative to NFS is provided by
	  the Coda file system; see "Coda file system support" below.

	  If you say Y here, you should have said Y to TCP/IP networking also.
	  This option would enlarge your kernel by about 27 KB.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called nfs.

	  If you are configuring a diskless machine which will mount its root
	  file system over NFS at boot time, say Y here and to "Kernel
	  level IP autoconfiguration" above and to "Root file system on NFS"
	  below. You cannot compile this driver as a module in this case.
	  There are two packages designed for booting diskless machines over
	  the net: netboot, available from
	  <http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/netboot/>, and Etherboot,
	  available from <http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/etherboot/>.

	  If you don't know what all this is about, say N.

	  If you want your Linux box to act as an NFS *server*, so that other
	  computers on your local network which support NFS can access certain
	  directories on your box transparently, you have two options: you can
	  use the self-contained user space program nfsd, in which case you
	  should say N here, or you can say Y and use the kernel based NFS
	  server. The advantage of the kernel based solution is that it is
	  faster.

	  In either case, you will need support software; the respective
	  locations are given in the file <file:Documentation/Changes> in the
	  NFS section.

	  If you say Y here, you will get support for version 2 of the NFS
	  protocol (NFSv2). If you also want NFSv3, say Y to the next question
	  as well.

	  Please read the NFS-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

Customizing the Busybox configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://www.busybox.net/[Busybox] is very configurable, and you may
want to customize it. You can just configure it via +Package selection+,
+Base System+, +Busybox Configuration+. The menu based busybox configuration
is mostly integrated into OpenADK. There are some options, which are not
available and not supported. If you need to, you can change the defaults
in +package/busybox/config+ and regenerate your OpenADK configuration.

A change in the busybox configuration will rebuild the busybox package. If you
choose another implementation of f.e. tar, which is provided by default from
busybox, tar in busybox will be deactivated and the package will be
automatically rebuilded, so that your resulting firmware images or archives
will only contain a single tar program. Obviously just the one you have
selected.

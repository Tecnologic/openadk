Customizing the toolchain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no simple way to change anything for the toolchain.
OpenADK chooses the best combination of the toolchain components to
provide you with a working and recent system.

If you like to change the version of a component, add patches or like
to change the configure options, you need to dig into the +toolchain+ directory.

For example to change the version of gcc, you need to change +toolchain/gcc/Makefile.inc+.
Be aware of the fact, that this is used for the +package/gcc/Makefile+ and therefore for
the gcc running on your target.

OpenADK supports running a cross-compiled toolchain on your target. You can even use OpenADK
buildsystem on your target. There is a package collection called +development+, which does 
configure OpenADK to include all required software to use OpenADK on your target.

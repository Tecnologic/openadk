Using +ccache+ in OpenADK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://ccache.samba.org[ccache] is a compiler cache. It stores the
object files resulting from each compilation process, and is able to
skip future compilation of the same source file (with same compiler
and same arguments) by using the pre-existing object files. When doing
almost identical builds from scratch a number of times, it can nicely
speed up the build process.

+ccache+ support is integrated in OpenADK. You just have to enable +Use ccache
to speedup recompilation+ in +Globale settings+. This will automatically build
+ccache+ and use it for every target compilation.

The cache is located in +$HOME/.ccache+. It is stored outside of OpenADK
directory so that it can be shared by separate OpenADK builds. If you want to
get rid of the cache, simply remove this directory.

[[hooks]]
Hooks available in the various build steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The infrastructure allow packages to specify hooks.  These define further
actions to perform after existing steps.  Most hooks aren't really useful for
manual packages, since the +Makefile+ already has full control over the
actions performed in each step of the package construction.

The following hook targets are available:

* +post-extract+
* +post-patch+
* +pre-configure+
* +post-configure+
* +pre-build+
* +post-build+
* +pre-install+
* +post-install+

For example, to make some scripts executable after extraction,
add following to your +Makefile+:

---------------------
post-extract:
	chmod a+x $(WRKBUILD)/build/make/*.sh
	chmod a+x $(WRKBUILD)/build/make/*.pl
---------------------

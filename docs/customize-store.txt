Storing the configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have a OpenADK configuration that you are satisfied with and
you want to share it with others, put it under revision control or move
on to a different OpenADK project.

You just need to copy your .config and extra directory to regenerate your
firmware images on another system. The used config is, if not explicitely disabled,
saved on the target in +/etc/adkconfig.gz+.

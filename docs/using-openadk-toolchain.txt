Using the generated toolchain outside OpenADK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to compile, for your target, your own programs or other software
that are not packaged in OpenADK. In order to do this you can use the toolchain
that was generated by OpenADK.

The toolchain generated by OpenADK is located by default in
+host_<gnu_host_name>/+. The simplest way to use it is to add
+host_<gnu_host_name>/bin/+ to your PATH environment variable and then to use
+<arch>-<vendor>-linux-<libcsuffix>-gcc+,
+<arch>-<vendor>-linux-<libcsuffix>-objdump+, etc.

It is possible to relocate the toolchain, you just need to put
+target_<arch>_<libc>_<abi>+ into the same directory as
+host_<gnu_host_name>/+.

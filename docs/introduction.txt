About OpenADK
=============

OpenADK is a tool that simplifies and automates the process of
building a complete Linux system for an embedded system, using
cross-compilation. ADK stands for appliance development kit.

In order to achieve this, OpenADK is able to generate a
cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem, a Linux kernel image
and a bootloader for your target. 

OpenADK is useful mainly for people working with embedded systems,
but can be used by people playing with emulators (like Qemu, Virtualbox 
or Aranym) or small netbooks (like Lemote Yeelong) needing a fast
and small Linux system.

Embedded systems often use processors that are not the regular x86
processors everyone is used to having in his PC. They can be PowerPC
processors, MIPS processors, ARM processors, etc.

OpenADK supports numerous processors and their variants; it also comes
with default configurations for some embedded systems and netbooks.

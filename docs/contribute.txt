Contributing to OpenADK
=======================

If you want to contribute to OpenADK, you will need a git view of
the project. Refer to xref:getting-openadk[] to get it.

You can either subscribe to the mailing list dev@openadk.org or
send an email directly to wbx@openadk.org.

[[submitting-patches]]
Submitting patches
------------------

When your changes are done, and committed in your local git view,
_rebase_ your development branch on top of the upstream tree before
generating the patch set. To do so, run:

---------------------
$ git fetch --all --tags
$ git rebase origin/master
---------------------

Here, you are ready to generate then submit your patch set.

To generate it, run:

---------------------
$ git format-patch -M -n -s origin/master
---------------------

This will generate patch files automatically adding the +Signed-off-by+ line.

Once patch files are generated, you can review/edit the commit message
before submitting them using your favorite text editor.

Lastly, send/submit your patch set to the OpenADK developers:

---------------------
$ git send-email --to dev@openadk.org *.patch
---------------------

Note that +git+ should be configured to use your mail account.
To configure +git+, see +man git-send-email+ or google it.

Make sure posted *patches are not line-wrapped*, otherwise they cannot
easily be applied. In such a case, fix your e-mail client, or better,
use +git send-email+ to send your patches.

Cover letter
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to present the whole patch set in a separate mail, add
+--cover-letter+ to the +git format-patch+ command (see +man
git-format-patch+ for further information). This will generate a
template for an introduction e-mail to your patch series.

A 'cover letter' may be useful to introduce the changes you propose
in the following cases:

* large number of commits in the series;

* deep impact of the changes in the rest of the project;

* RFC footnote:[RFC: (Request for comments) change proposal];

* whenever you feel it will help presenting your work, your choices,
  the review process, etc.

[[reporting-bugs]]
Reporting issues/bugs, get help
-------------------------------

Try to think as if you were trying to help someone else; in
that case, what would you need?

Here is a short list of details to provide in such case:

* host machine (OS/release)
* git version of OpenADK
* target for which the build fails
* package(s) which the build fails
* the command that fails and its output
* the make.log file, generated when make v is used
* any information you think that may be relevant

Additionally, you can add the +.config+ file.

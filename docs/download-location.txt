Location of downloaded packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The various tarballs that are downloaded by OpenADK are all stored
in +ADK_DL_DIR+, which by default is the +dl+ directory. If you want
to keep a complete version of OpenaDK which is known to be working
with the associated tarballs, you can make a copy of this directory.
This will allow you to regenerate the toolchain and the target
filesystem with exactly the same versions.

If you maintain several OpenADK trees, it might be better to have a
shared download location. This can be achieved by pointing the
+DL_DIR+ environment variable to a directory.  If this is
set, then the value of +ADK_DL_DIR+ in the OpenADK configuration is
overridden. The following line should be added to +<~/.bashrc>+.

-----------------
 $ export DL_DIR=<shared download location>
-----------------

The download location can also be set in the +.config+ file, with the
+ADK_DL_DIR+ option. Unlike most options in the .config file, this value
is overridden by the +DL_DIR+ environment variable.

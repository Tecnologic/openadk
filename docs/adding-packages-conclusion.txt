Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see, adding a software package to OpenADK is simply a
matter of writing a Makefile using an existing template and modifying it
according to the compilation process required by the package.

If you package software that might be useful for other people, don't
forget to send a patch to the OpenADK developer (see xref:submitting-patches[])!
